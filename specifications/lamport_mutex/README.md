# Distributed mutual exclusion
TLA+ specification and proof of Lamport's distributed mutual-exclusion
algorithm that appeared as an example in

L. Lamport:  Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed
System. CACM 21(7):558-565, 1978.

The module contains a hierarchical proof of mutual exclusion, based on
the definition of an inductive invariant and its proof using TLAPS.
