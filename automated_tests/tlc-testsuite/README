This directory contains regression tests for TLC.  

As of 10 April 11, the way to run regression tests is
  win7-test2.bat >& test2.yy-mm-dd
As of 24 October 12, it seems necessary to run it as
  ./win7-test2.bat >& test2.yy-mm-dd
As of 13 Mar 2013, I set it up so ./win7-office-test2.bat is
  the file to run.

As of 29 Nov 2005, the following test files revealed bugs:

   test6  - TLC not making proper use of level info when splitting
            next-state action.
   test57 - Subtle bug in handling ENABLED under instantiation 
   test58 - Parser doesn't handle octal, binary, and hex numbers.
   test60 - TLC incorrectly handles escape characters in a string 
            so that Len does not count them properly.
            - Corrected after 26 apr 2006
   test61 - instantiation of form Foo(X) == INSTANCE ...  doesn't work.

   etest7 - TLC fails to complain about a CONSTANT statement in the 
            cfg file replacing a constant by a non-constant.

Note: testN for N > 200 are tests for tlc2 (or sany2)
   test210 and test217 are supposed to produce errors.

List of files:

   index.txt
     Lists all the tests--but not up to date.

   test.bat
     Runs all correct tests.  Run in cygwin with
     test.bat >& test.yy-mm-dd
   
   test2.bat
     Like test.bat, except for TLC2
     AS OF 27 May 2010, THIS SEEMED TO BE THE ONE TO USE

   eclipse-test2.bat 
     Like test.bat, except for TLC2 and using the Eclipse version 

   etest.bat
     Runs all error tests.  Run in cygwin with
     etest.bat >& etest.01-12-31    
   
   test*.{tla,cfg}
      Tests that should be correct.
   
   etest*.{tla,cfg}
      Tests that should produce errors.
 
   test.yy-mm-dd
   etest.yy-mm-dd
     Results of running test.bat and etest.bat on date yy-mm-dd
   
   dotests
      An obsolete unix shell script to run all the tests.
   
   test-run.yy-mm-dd
      The output from running dotests with the version of TLC dated
      yy-mm-dd.

To run a regression test on Digital Unix, type

   dotests >& test-run.yy-mm-dd &
   tail -f test-run.yy-mm-dd

and the use dxdiff to compare the output with the previous test.
